# Designing and Developing Safety Circuits for Electric Vehicles on a PCB
The goal of this project is to design and construct PCBs for important safety circuits for electric vehicles (EVs), with an emphasis on the shutdown, BSPD (Brake System Plausibility Device), and TSAL (Traction System Active Light) circuits. These circuits were created with Proteus, then Altium Software was used to convert the concepts into PCB layouts in order to guarantee dependable and sturdy performance for our club's electric car project.<br/>
## Features
1.The TSAL (Traction System Active Light) warns users of possible dangers and indicates whether the high-voltage system is operational.<br/>
2.The Brake System Plausibility Device, or BSPD, keeps an eye on the brake system to make sure everything is operating as it should and has the ability to shut it down if any irregularities are found.<br/>
3.Shutdown Circuit: In an emergency, this circuit offers a fail-safe way to swiftly and securely turn off the car's systems.<br/>
## Design Tools and Technologies
Design Software: Proteus Software PCB Design Software: PCB layouts were created by the help of Altium Software.
